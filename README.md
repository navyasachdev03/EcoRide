## EcoRide

Ecoride is a carpooling website that allows users to search and book shared rides, making travel more eco-friendly and cost-effective. Drivers can also publish their rides after creating a verified driver profile. The project is built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

### Features

- User Authentication: Secure registration and login for users.
- Search & Book Rides: Users can search for shared rides and book them based on their preferences.
- Driver Profile: Drivers can create a verified profile and publish rides.
- Ride Management: Manage your published or booked rides from the dashboard.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive design that works on all devices.

```plaintext
PORT=8000                                       # The port on which the backend server will run
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_uri                    # The MongoDB connection string
CORS_ORIGIN=*                                   # The origin allowed for CORS requests (adjust as necessary)

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret    # Secret key for access token JWT
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d                          # Access token expiry time

REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret  # Secret key for refresh token JWT
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d                        # Refresh token expiry time

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name      # Cloudinary cloud name
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_KEY=your_cloudinary_key        # Cloudinary API key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret  # Cloudinary API secret
```

- PORT: The port on which the backend server will run.
- MONGODB_URL: The MongoDB connection string.
- CORS_ORIGIN: The origin allowed for CORS requests (set to * to allow all origins, but it’s recommended to restrict it in production).
- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: A secret key for signing access token JWTs.
- ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY: Expiration time for access tokens (e.g., 1h for 1 hour or 1d for 1 day).
- REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY: Expiration time for refresh tokens (e.g., 10d for 10 days).
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: Your Cloudinary cloud name for image storage.
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_KEY: Your Cloudinary API key.
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_SECRET: Your Cloudinary API secret.
